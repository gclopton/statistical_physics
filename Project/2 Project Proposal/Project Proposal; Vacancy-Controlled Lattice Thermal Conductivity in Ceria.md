**Vacancy-Controlled Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Ceria $\mathrm{CeO}_{2-x}$ : A Green-Kubo Study with Potential-Model Sensitivity**


## 1. Scientific question and hypotheses

This project asks how the lattice thermal conductivity κ(T)\kappa(T) of ceria evolves as oxygen vacancies are introduced and as temperature varies, and to what extent any conclusions depend on the interatomic potential used in molecular dynamics (MD). The working hypotheses are twofold. First, increasing the vacancy fraction xx should systematically depress κ\kappa because point defects enhance phonon–defect scattering; moreover, the relative reduction is expected to grow with temperature in a manner that reflects the dominant phonon mean free paths. Second, the qualitative trends (e.g., monotonic decrease with xx, conventional TT-dependence at fixed xx) should be robust across widely used rigid-ion potentials for CeO2_2 (e.g., Götte-type and Grimes-type parametrizations), while the quantitative values of κ\kappa will likely differ by amounts that exceed statistical uncertainty. Recent defect-calibrated potentials developed to better capture Ce3+^{3+}/Ce4+^{4+} chemistry may shift magnitudes further; the study therefore treats the choice of potential as a controlled sensitivity factor rather than an afterthought.

## 2. Approach overview

The study will use equilibrium MD with the Green–Kubo (GK) formalism implemented in LAMMPS. For each state point, the system is equilibrated in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble to relax the volume and pressure, transitioned to canonical (NVT) to settle the temperature, and then propagated microcanonically (NVE) to generate stationary trajectories for transport analysis. The microscopic heat flux will be computed with LAMMPS’ standard `compute heat/flux` in conjunction with compatible per-atom energy and stress terms. The heat current autocorrelation function (HCACF) will be accumulated using time-correlation utilities and integrated to a plateau to obtain the conductivity tensor; isotropic averages will be reported when appropriate. Uncertainty will be estimated with a conservative, literature-standard strategy that combines block averaging of independent NVE segments with a window-length scan and a Sokal-style statistical inefficiency analysis to account for time correlations in the HCACF integral. The workflow and diagnostics will be aligned with the GK “how-to” guidance and command documentation from LAMMPS and with best-practice tutorials.

Design variables include vacancy fraction x∈{0, 0.03, 0.06}x\in\{0,\,0.03,\,0.06\} (with room to extend), temperatures T∈{300, 600, 900} KT\in\{300,\,600,\,900\}\,\mathrm{K} as a representative set spanning near-ambient to high-temperature operation, and the interatomic potential model. Validation is anchored by reproducing the magnitude and temperature trend of κ\kappa for stoichiometric bulk CeO2_2 reported in MD–experiment comparison studies; only after reaching acceptable agreement at x=0x=0 will vacancy effects and potential sensitivity be explored.

## 3. System construction and interatomic potentials

Ceria will be modeled in its fluorite structure using supercells large enough to stabilize GK statistics (targeting on the order of tens of thousands of atoms, e.g., 8×8×88\times8\times8 conventional cells when feasible). Oxygen vacancies will be introduced at random sites consistent with the target xx, with careful bookkeeping of defect distributions across replicas to separate physics from sampling noise. Charge neutrality will be enforced in the spirit of reduced ceria by associating each O vacancy with the reduction of nearby Ce4+^{4+} to Ce3+^{3+}; in rigid-ion models this effect is captured implicitly through parametrization, and the limitations of that approximation will be discussed.

Three potential choices frame the model-dependence study. A Götte-type rigid-ion Buckingham parametrization serves as a widely used baseline for reduced ceria; a Grimes-type Buckingham/Coulomb set provides an alternative with a different balance of elastic, defect, and thermodynamic properties; and one modern, defect-calibrated potential (e.g., a 2020s vintage model tuned explicitly to vacancy formation and Ce redox energetics) will be included to probe whether improved defect fidelity materially shifts κ\kappa predictions. Prior assessment papers that rank Götte/Grimes among the stronger “classic” potentials motivate the first two selections, while the recent defect-aware model provides a targeted sensitivity check.

## 4. Simulation protocol

Each state point follows a standardized protocol. After building or loading the supercell and placing vacancies, the system is minimized and then equilibrated in NPT to zero pressure at the target temperature with long-range electrostatics (e.g., PPPM) configured consistently with the chosen potential. A subsequent NVT hold ensures tight temperature control before a switch to NVE for production. The heat current is computed from per-atom kinetic energy, potential energy, and virial stress contributions; known caveats for Coulombic systems in GK (e.g., how long-range energy partitioning enters `compute heat/flux`) will be followed as documented. Production comprises multiple independent NVE segments (distinct random seeds and starting times), each long enough to expose a stable HCACF tail; the segments are post-processed to yield cumulative conductivity integrals with visible plateaus and conservative error bars. For a one-point cross-check on methodology rather than a duplicate data set, the study may perform a reverse non-equilibrium MD (RNEMD) calculation via `fix thermal/conductivity` on stoichiometric CeO2_2 at a single temperature to confirm that GK and RNEMD agree within their expected differences.

## 5. Expected results and risks

Once size and time convergence are achieved, stoichiometric ceria should show a decreasing κ\kappa with increasing temperature, with absolute values that fall within the spread of prior MD and laser-flash measurements. Introducing oxygen vacancies is expected to reduce κ\kappa monotonically with xx because of added point-defect scattering; the effect size should be comparable to, or larger than, the statistical uncertainty and may depend on the spatial statistics of vacancy placement. The largest risk is a drifting GK plateau or an HCACF that decays too slowly for a clean integral. This will be mitigated by extending NVE length, increasing the number of statistically independent replicas, and using window-selection diagnostics that penalize late-time noise. A second risk is potential-specific treatment of Ce3+^{3+}/vacancy physics; this is addressed by analyzing at least two established rigid-ion models alongside one defect-calibrated modern potential and explicitly reporting the model-to-model spread as a component of uncertainty rather than burying it.

## 6. Deliverables

The project will deliver a complete, reusable LAMMPS input suite and a Python post-processing toolkit that computes the HCACF, performs window scans and block averaging, and outputs per-component and isotropic conductivities with conservative error bars. The central data product is κ(T,x)\kappa(T,x) with uncertainties for each potential, together with a potential-sensitivity comparison that separates statistical error from model spread. The report will include representative HCACFs and cumulative-integral plots with shaded uncertainty, κ\kappa versus TT at fixed xx, κ\kappa versus xx at fixed TT, and side-by-side comparisons across potentials. All inputs, analysis scripts, and figure-generation code will be version-controlled; the final manuscript will be prepared in an Overleaf repository consistent with course requirements.

## 7. Timeline

The work is staged to de-risk validation early and to front-load the analysis pipeline. In the first two weeks, supercells and a vacancy-insertion utility will be built, and a baseline GK calculation for CeO2_2 at 300 K will be validated against literature. Weeks three through five will complete a temperature sweep at x=0x=0 and finalize the uncertainty pipeline. Weeks six through eight will introduce vacancies at two concentrations (e.g., x=0.03x=0.03 and x=0.06x=0.06) at one temperature each, with multiple replicas to control sampling variance. Weeks nine and ten will repeat key points with an alternative rigid-ion potential and, if time permits, run the modern defect-calibrated model and the single RNEMD cross-check. The last two weeks are reserved for comparative analysis, writing, and figure refinement.

## Background and protocol anchors

The GK methodology, including the definition of the microscopic heat flux, required per-atom computes, and practical guidance for HCACF accumulation and integration, follows the LAMMPS documentation and tutorial materials. Validation targets and discussion of κ(T)\kappa(T) in bulk and porous ceria are drawn from open-access MD–experiment comparisons in the recent literature. Selection of the Götte- and Grimes-type potentials is motivated by critical assessments that benchmark classic parametrizations for elastic and defect properties; inclusion of a contemporary defect-calibrated model reflects ongoing progress toward consistent prediction of vacancy energetics and Ce redox chemistry. Together, these sources provide both a protocol backbone and a rationale for treating the potential as a first-class factor in the design.

## What you will take into the meeting

For discussion with your advisor or course team, prepare a concise slide that states the question, the two hypotheses, and the three experimental variables (T,x,potential)(T, x, \text{potential}), and a second slide that sketches the simulation pipeline (NPT →\rightarrow NVT →\rightarrow NVE), the GK analysis path, and the planned validation step at x=0x=0. Bring a short reading checklist that points to the LAMMPS GK “how-to” page, the `compute heat/flux` command notes, a representative MD–experiment ceria paper for κ(T)\kappa(T), and the potential-assessment study that justifies model choices. If desired, I can also supply a minimal Python scaffold for HCACF integration and blocking so you can begin plugging in trajectories as soon as the first NVE segments finish.
