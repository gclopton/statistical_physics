> 1.) Suppose you are studying a phase transition from liquid to gas. Describe an order parameter to keep track of, and what you expect to see on the transition.

> 3.) Suppose that in a box with rigid sides, there are $10^9 \mathrm{~N}_2$ molecules. It sits in a room with an air temperature of 295 K . Assume that we will treat the system using classical mechanics.
> 1. If you were to simulate this system at the atomic scale, what variables would be used to describe the state of the gas?
> 2. What is the dimension of the phase space of the gas?
> 3. Is the energy of the gas a conserved quantity? Why or why not?
> 4. What probability distribution over the gas's state applies to this situation?
