is a molecular mechanics force field. Every atom is assigned an atom type that encodes its local chemical environment, and those types are keys used to look up parameters for bond, angle, dihedral (torsion), and nonbonded (Lennard-Jones + partial charges) terms.


In **OPLS-AA (All Atom)**, the common codes include
- _CT:_ aliphatic $sp^{3}$ carbon (alkane carbon)
- _HC:_ hydrogen attached to an aliphatic carbon
- _CA:_ aromatic $\mathrm{sp}^2 \mathrm{C}$
- _OH:_ alcohol O
- _OS:_ ether O
- _HA:_ aromatic H
